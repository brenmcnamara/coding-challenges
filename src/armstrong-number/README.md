# Armstrong Numbers

An armstrong number is a number where the sum of its digits, each to the power of the total number of digits, is equal to the number itself.

For example: 371 is an armstrong number. 371 has 3 digits so raise each digits to the power of 3 and take the sum:

3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 371

Write algorithm that takes a number and determines if it is an armstrong number.
